Video Mush Toolbox was a platform for implementing efficient GPU-based image processing that I built during my PhD at the University of Warwick. It depended heavily on external libraries to provide a graphics layer, a runtime UI, path tracing, some of which have not been publicly released. I am uploading it to provide code samples for the various algorithms implemented and also as a personal reference.
